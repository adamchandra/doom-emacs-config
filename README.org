What you *really* want is the =M-x org-html-export-to-html= version of ~config.org~ ,
or the =M-x org-latex-export-to-pdf= version (linked in the title).

In addition to the =html= export, this /produces/ the [[https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/init.el.html][init.el]], [[https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.el.html][config.el]], and [[https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/packages.el.html][packages.el]] files.

Other than that, snippets are (currently) sourced from the [[file:snippets/][snippets]] folder,
resources are put in [[file:misc/][misc]], and you may find submodules for packages of mine in
[[file:lisp/][lisp]], along with extra major modes.
